Depth based procedures for multivariate, multiple change in variability detection


Codes for running the procedure are contained in the main folder. You need the files PELT_Alg.R , PELT_CPP.cpp and WBS_algorithms.R to run the algorithms. 

The simulation study and the data analysis are also in this repository.
